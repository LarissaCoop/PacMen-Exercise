  <a href="https://github.com/LarissaCoop/PacMen-Exercise ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PacMen Factory Game</a>
<p>Description:This is a game where we press a button in the DOM to make a PacMan and they randomly move once the game is started.</p>
<p> How to run:  In essence you will download the files and same them in a folder.  You will open the folder in your text editor.  You will either fun 
  Live Server if using VS code or an open with command and select a browser.  In the case of PacMen, you will click on making a PacMan button 
  and then on the start button to watch the PacMen move.</p>
<p>Roadmap: I am thinking of adding in different creatures, including a Mrs. PacMan and Baby PacMen.</P>
